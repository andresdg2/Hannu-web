The AI engineer was tasked with building an e-commerce site for HANNU CLOTHES, which quickly pivoted to a professional catalog system. Initial work involved UI/UX development using React, Tailwind, and Shadcn UI, featuring a soft pink aesthetic. Key challenges included implementing a PSE payment gateway (though the e-commerce aspect was later de-prioritized), robust image handling (Google Drive link conversion, addressing hotlinking, and proposing external image hosting), and developing a comprehensive admin panel for inventory management. The AI iteratively refined the application, adapting to user feedback on content, layout, and functionality, such as reorganizing sections, updating contact information, adding policy details, and introducing complex product attributes like multiple images and colors. Debugging image persistence and admin authentication issues formed a significant part of the development, culminating in a functionally rich and responsive catalog.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a website for HANNU CLOTHES, a women's clothing brand, initially as an e-commerce platform allowing customers to buy items and the brand to manage inventory (add/delete/edit photos and text). Product information (specifications, composition, care, shipping, exchange policies) should be displayed upon clicking an item. The UI needed a feminine touch with a soft pink palette from the logo.
The requirements evolved into a professional catalog system with specific categories (Dresses, Jumpsuits, Outfits, Tops, Skirts & Pants), wholesale and retail pricing, inventory management (add/delete/edit photos/text), detailed product information (in Spanish), and a dedicated admin panel for updates. Further refinements included dynamic image handling (Google Drive link conversion, direct image URLs, and recommended hosting solutions), adding a WhatsApp button, social media links (Instagram, Facebook), detailed company policies, responsiveness, and finally, support for multiple product images and colors with an interactive carousel. A pending task is specific user authentication for the admin panel.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX:** Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, responsive design, custom styling.
-   **API Communication:** Axios for frontend-backend interaction with  prefix.
-   **Data Handling:** Pydantic for FastAPI models, MongoDB for persistence, UUIDs for IDs.
-   **Image Management:** Google Drive URL conversion logic, direct image linking, debugging hotlinking issues.
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for service management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/backend/server.py:**
    -   **Importance:** Core backend application. Handles API route definitions (), CRUD operations for products, and interaction with the MongoDB database. It defines Pydantic models for data validation and ensures data is stored and retrieved correctly.
    -   **Changes:** Initially set up with basic product CRUD. Adapted to support a catalog system rather than full e-commerce. Updated to handle an expanded product schema to include multiple images and color variations for each product.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js:**
    -   **Importance:** The main React component that orchestrates the entire user interface. It contains the application's layout, routing logic (though implicitly managed by a single-page app structure here), component rendering (hero, navigation, product catalog, modals, admin panel), and state management. It handles all frontend API requests to the backend.
    -   **Changes:** Underwent significant transformations. Initial e-commerce elements were replaced with catalog-specific features. Logic for displaying product categories, handling dual pricing (retail/wholesale), and managing product details was implemented. An admin panel was developed for adding, editing, and deleting products. Crucially, image handling was improved with Google Drive link conversion and image testing tools. Contact information, policy sections, WhatsApp, and social media links were integrated. The product data model within the frontend was extended to support multiple image URLs (for a carousel) and multiple colors per product, alongside corresponding admin panel inputs. Bugs related to data persistence (saving/loading products from backend) and frontend authentication ( state) were debugged and fixed.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css:**
    -   **Importance:** Defines the visual presentation of the entire application. It uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and applies a consistent soft pink color palette, ensuring a feminine touch as requested. It manages responsive layouts for various screen sizes.
    -   **Changes:** Extensive additions and modifications were made to style new sections (policies, contact), integrate new UI elements (WhatsApp button, social media icons, image carousel), and refine existing components for improved aesthetics and responsiveness. Styles were added for loading states, image placeholders, and administrative tools like the Google Drive link converter and image URL tester. Specific attention was paid to ensuring the image modal displayed full images, and the overall catalog adapted well to mobile views.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Admin User Authentication:** Implement specific user authentication (email and password) for accessing the administrative panel, rather than simplified or open access. This requires deeper backend changes.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major set of enhancements, transforming the HANNU CLOTHES catalog into a more professional and feature-rich system. The hero section's text has been updated to Confeccionamos modelos espec√≠ficos, and the hero image changed to a Vestido Sorelle Negro. Crucially, the product model now supports **multiple images** (for an interactive carousel) and **multiple color options** for each garment.

The frontend () reflects these changes:  components are updated to display multiple images, and the product modal has been refined to show all available images and color choices while removing outdated elements like shipping policies and stock display. The administrative panel has also been significantly upgraded to include fields for managing these multiple images (with individual Google Drive conversion tools) and colors. CSS () has been updated to provide appropriate styling for the new image carousel and the enhanced product modal.

The application is responsive, contact information (WhatsApp, Instagram, location) is up-to-date, policies are displayed correctly, and the core product management functionality appears robust. The AI has asked the user to verify these comprehensive updates.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to await the user's detailed review and verification of the recently implemented features, especially the multi-image carousel, multi-color options, and the updated admin panel.
