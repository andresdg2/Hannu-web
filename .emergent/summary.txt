The AI engineer has been meticulously developing and refining the HANNU CLOTHES catalog application. Initially, the focus was on UI/UX with React, Tailwind, and Shadcn UI, robust image handling (evolving from Google Drive to addressing hotlinking/CORS), and an administrative panel for product management. Recurring challenges included data persistence, backend-frontend model synchronization, and ensuring responsive, user-friendly functionality. Persistent issues included images failing to load, products not saving or disappearing, and the application's 24/7 availability. The engineer implemented an image proxy, migrated images to ImgBB (including a mass upload feature), added manager authentication, password recovery, and enhanced responsiveness. The latest interactions revolve around persistent editing issues for specific products (the first 4) and the application's reported failure to operate 24/7 independently, despite previous configurations. The engineer acknowledged previous unauthorized modifications and committed to only making explicit changes. The last action was an attempt to start solving these two critical, persistent problems.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a professional online catalog system for HANNU CLOTHES, evolving from an e-commerce platform. The system must display women's clothing products with detailed specifications (composition, care, shipping, exchange policies, payment methods, entrega inmediata), offer wholesale/retail pricing, and feature a comprehensive admin panel for inventory management (add/delete/edit products, photos, text). The UI needs a feminine touch with a soft pink palette, support specific categories (Dresses, Jumpsuits, Outfits, Tops & Bodys, Skirts & Pants), responsive design, and integrate WhatsApp and social media links. Further enhancements included multi-image carousels, multiple color and size options (free-text), removal of stock display, and a search function. Critical issues addressed include fixing product saving, resolving image loading failures (migrating from PostImg to ImgBB via a proxy/mass upload script), implementing a manager authentication system with password recovery, refining UI responsiveness, and ensuring the application operates 24/7 independently. Current efforts focus on addressing specific product editing limitations and solidifying 24/7 availability.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX:** Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, responsive design.
-   **API Communication:** Axios with  prefix, JWT for authentication.
-   **Data Handling:** Pydantic models, MongoDB persistence, UUIDs.
-   **Image Management:** Google Drive, PostImg (CORS), ImgBB (migration), image proxy (), image placeholders.
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor (autostart/autorestart), environment variables.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture:


-   **/app/backend/server.py:**
    -   **Importance:** Core backend application handling API routes, CRUD operations for products, and MongoDB interaction. Defines Pydantic models for data validation.
    -   **Changes:** Product schema updated (, , ), CRUD endpoints modified (price types, new fields), categories updated. Implemented product sorting for , manager login ( with JWT), a proxy for images (, later removed due to DNS issues), and an endpoint for mass image upload (). Replaced hardcoded JWT secret with an environment variable.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js:**
    -   **Importance:** Main React component orchestrating UI, component rendering, and frontend API requests.
    -   **Changes:** Significant updates for catalog features, admin panel, multi-image carousel, color/size options. Admin panel logic enhanced (saving/editing, error handling, product limit ). Product details modal updated (removed care/specifications, restored composition, added payment methods/delivery messages). Category dropdown and main navigation updated. Search functionality implemented. Robust image fallback/placeholders added (evolved to use proxy, then direct optimized PostImg URLs, then a  component). Implemented manager login form, state management for authentication, and logout. Added mass image upload interface. Removed user test info and added password recovery. Modified the main hamburger menu to include direct navigation to sections (, , , ). Reordered product details display. Configured desktop menu to be a hamburger menu, consistent with mobile.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css:**
    -   **Importance:** Defines the application's visual presentation using Tailwind CSS and a soft pink palette.
    -   **Changes:** Extensive additions for new sections (policies, contact, immediate delivery), UI elements (WhatsApp, social media, image carousel), and refinements for aesthetics and responsiveness. Styles added for loading states, image placeholders, color/size inputs, search input. Added styles for manager login, mass upload interface (including scrollable modals), and new menu elements. General responsiveness improvements for header, hero section, and product grid.
-   **/app/backend/migrate_images.py:** Python script created to automate the migration of image URLs from PostImg to ImgBB using the ImgBB API key provided by the user.
-   **/app/backend/cleanup_duplicates.py, restore_products.py, remove_duplicates_only.py:** Python scripts created to manage (delete/restore/selectively remove) duplicate product entries in MongoDB, in response to user feedback.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and definitively fix the issue where the application reportedly still becomes unavailable (not 24/7 active) when the AI agent is asleep.
-   Investigate and definitively fix the issue where specific products (the first 4 in the catalog) cannot be edited or deleted via the admin panel.
-   Address missing images for Imperio and Velvet products.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical debugging phase focusing on two persistent issues reported by the user:
1.  **Application 24/7 Availability**: The user continues to report that the catalog becomes inaccessible when the AI agent is inactive, contradicting previous configurations intended to ensure independent 24/7 operation. The deployment agent had previously identified hardcoded secrets in source files as a blocker, which the engineer attempted to resolve by moving  to an environment variable in  and updating . However, the user's latest report indicates the problem persists, suggesting further investigation is needed for the deployment configuration.
2.  **Product Editing/Deletion Issues**: The user reported that specific products, particularly the first 4 displayed in the catalog, cannot be edited or deleted through the admin interface. Additionally, products like Imperio and Velvet lack images, showing placeholders. Previous attempts to resolve similar issues involved managing duplicate products in the database (which led to accidental deletion and subsequent restoration). The engineer's last action in Chat Message 609 was to acknowledge these dual problems (Imperio and Velvet missing images, first 4 products uneditable) and declare a plan to solve both problems, followed by a  tool response in Chat Message 610, indicating the very initial step of this new attempt failed.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the uneditable first 4 products and the persistent 24/7 application availability issues.
